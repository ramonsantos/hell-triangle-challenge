# Hell Triangle

## Challenge

Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

Example:


```
   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4
```

In this triangle the maximum total is: â€‹ **6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26**

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.
For example: The element *3* in the 2nd row can only be summed with *9* and *7*, but not with
*1*.

Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.
The triangle from above would be:

``` ruby
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
```

## Why Ruby?
